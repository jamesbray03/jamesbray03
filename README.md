# About Me
Hi, I'm James Bray, an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Sheffield. 

This is my portfolio where I keep code for my projects, apps, and anything else I feel might be worth sharing. I am a self-taught programmer, constantly exploring different programming languages to craft solutions that enhance my problem-solving abilities and overall software development skills. All of my code is open source and I encourage improvements and innovations.

I have other (non-software based) projects on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesbray03), so please feel free to have a look at those.
